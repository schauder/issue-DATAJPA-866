== Project to play around with IdClasses

This repository serves as a playground for reproducing DATAJPA-866.

It contains

* a simple domain model
* a Spring Boot test exercising that model (acutally just loading the context)
* a `PlainJpaMain` which exercises the model just using JPA, without Spring.

In the current state both, JPA Application and Spring Test work fine.

If one removes the name attribute form `Dependent` and `DependentId` both fail to work.
